The ldap4openvpn project is aimed to add LDAP Functionality to openvpn, this curently means authentication and various authorization issues. Currently the code only offers the authentication plugin.
The ldap4openvpn project is a fork of the original code written as a side project of the [University of Athens email](http://email.uoa.gr/) project from:
**Aristotelis Glentis**,
**Stamatis Glykos** and
**Vaggelis Georgatos**.
